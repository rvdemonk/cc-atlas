# notes

- when does a dir need a claude file?
- what is the prompt to create the claude file?
- what is the format of the claude file?
- what should be included?

these are the decisions and tasks that should be automated by cc-atlas, context engineered for a cc command.

## ux

- use command with arg of dir, or whole project
- cc agents create claude files for each major junction

## updates

- how to keep the claude files up to date with minimal overhead?
